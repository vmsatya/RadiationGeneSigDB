# RadiationGeneSigDB
A comprehensive database of oxic and hypoxic radiation response gene expression signatures.
RadiationGeneSigDB has a collection of 11 oxic and 24 hypoxic signatures with the standardized gene list as a gene symbol, Entrez gene id along with its function. We present the utility of this database through two case studies: i) comparing breast cancer oxic signatures in cell line data vs. patient data; and ii) comparing the similarity of head and neck cancer hypoxia signatures in clinical tumor data. This valuable, curated repertoire of published gene expression signatures provides a motivating example for how to search for similarities in radiation response for tumors arising from different tissues  across model systems under oxic and hypoxic conditions. To assay the quality of gene signatures, we used our recently developed method siqQC (available as R package).
